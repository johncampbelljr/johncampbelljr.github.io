One of the things that I like about my daughter is how she is so biased to action. A therapist friend uses the metric 'say-do gap' to
indicate the difference between things you say you are going to do and things you actually do. I suffer from a large say-do gap and nothing could make this clear than the ten year plan that I wrote eight years ago. How many things have I crossed off the list? None. Zero. Zip. Well, one was "better comms with my dad" and he has since passed away so I guess I can count that as one?

To help with a bias toward inertia you can employ the 56 second rule, or the just do it rule or anything that make committing to action better. A documentary on the twin mars rovers Curiosity and Spirit talked about how NASA kept up the tradition of playing wake-up songs for astronauts with the rovers. (When they thought one rover was dead they played Abba's SOS and it sprang to life (as much as a rover can spring)). I thought it would be great to have someone send me a wake up song each day.

Hence the idea for the wake up app. I spun up a little project file and started banging out some code. The tech the app would use would be mainstream but a lot of different pieces. For example:
* the frontend would be a web app using react.
* a node api would handled the backend
* spotify would be used to search for songs
* twillio would be used to message
* mysql would store the data
* secualize would be used as the node ORM

These are all things that I had a bit of experience with but there was going to be a lot of new stuff and lots of lessons to learn on the way. I figure I should keep a log of the lessons I'm learning and possibly augment some information on the web that is a bit confusing or out of date.

So let's go!
